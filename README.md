#Reflesction 11
##5/18/2018
It's time to say good bye, it's been a long time sice I have got to this school, and for the last year of my high school life, it's good to choose Computer programing as one of my snior clases, it's fun most of the time, but, also challenging, I still remainber in the begining of the year, I start with the class with out knowing anything about all the things that I have learn now.
I start with programing on the second semester and I start to learn how to right a list on the github, and how to uploade the homework to the github. then we start to learn how to right all kind of fun things on putty.
After we learned how to use Putty, we move on to learn how to use python 2 on the putty, how you would run it, and how you should write code on the putty and put it in use.
After learning all this things, I now have knoun how to write a code that can do if somrthing then something, while something then something, it's all a part of computer language, and with all this code, I have acomplish many problem, again it's fun but also hard, Like for a few time, I had to do the coding after taps, and till 12 on the night, so the WIFI shut off, and I will have no choice then just shut down the computer and go to bed.
So, it's good, I have some how enjoy doing this, and I still like to learn more about it.y

#Reflection 10
##5/11/2018
The few weeks i have not done a reflection, on this few weeks, I have done a lot.
I start more on the Google friday project, its looking pretty good now. I start with making a board, which I first thought to make a 5*5 board but lay=ter I think 10*10 is better. And I did a little research on what is going to be the most important thing for my battalship board game, It should be how I am gpoint to make the player get the right place on where they want to hit. too big of a map, can lead to the player playing a longer game.
Then we did some work on Kada, which is a web coding problem, that you can do coding on the web.
One of the best problem I see is where we should separate the word from a long letter of sentence, which then I can get the words of a song from it, it's cool but also hard to do, because its been a wile sence I havent done anything with word counting and Len() of something, But then we get to learn how to get all this strait, when the teacher told us, how did it work out.

This week we all got back with the unfinished homw owrk on the dice.py because we did not do them over time, instand we did all in the last night, so most of us did not finish.
The work I had was unfinished too, I had the definationto be that it will tellthe computer to add number directly in the function, and turn the number of the game the olayer win out.
But iod did not work that way, I had to change a lot to make sure it works, in finaly worked, why? because I put the function on only telling me who win not how many they win, then I can add them up, then come with the final winner, then the problem is solved.

The week start with learning three more things, one is def and another is the advanced programming on how to get the list work more better.
The def full name is defination, it just like what it sounds like, its a deffination on the code. We use the def to write a code that will let other code read it, and let the other code understand what they need to do.
Once we are done with the def code, we can start write the normal code, and in the normal code, we can use the def to let the code run it, and what ever you put in the def, the code will be abal to run it through that way, and then you can use def for many time, def is basicaly a code that will make a word to become a code that will work.

This week is a pretty easy week, the first day we start with learning more about how the booleam wors, and how it can be more advanced, and the new home word is really hard for me now, but I am still working on it, it needs more work with string and booleam.
I start with making a board, which is a 9*9 squared board, which the game should be all the line will be only nine numbers, and raw will be nine numbers, and every 3*3 square is the 1 - 9.
Then now I'm working on how to get the right number to fill in with the right block, which it should follow the the game rules, but that is the hard part wich I'm still working on now.

# Reflection 6

This week we got a extention on the homework for last week, it is because we did not have the time to finish it on last week's time, it needs more time them that to finish, I sit done for two hour just to finash the last problem.
The things that we learned this week, is more how to use if, and, or, and print the things that is if some thing happens, it will print, and when this did not happen, it wi$
The other one is that we get more in to the if statment, like we start to use and I start to learn more about the if and print statment, for the string. The one we start to do is to use and in a statement. In a statement, the and can work as a cannection point for two ro more statement, it will get like a sentence, and if the sentence is waht you want and also you want this sentence to work as this way too, if that is all you want you will get the sentence printed.
The next is to use or in the statement, the or is tohave a sentence for example, you want this sentence to work this way or you want this sentence to work this way, and the and, or two word can be use in a same statement, and make sure we need to put a ()on each side of the and, or statement.

This week we keep learning about string and booliam, the advanced part of all this. I learned how to make a python file with if and else and elif.
IF I use when I need to start to say I need to get the answer in order, and get them to match what I want.
Elif is use for when if ia being used and I still have some thing els that I need to add for the equation, then I can use elif, it can be understand as else if.
The last is else, for this one I don't have to say anything is equal to anything, it just mean, if the user type something that is not in theselaction of my word ort number, it will be put in to else. then I can just print, have the user reput in a number or word.

# Reflection 4
## 2/16/2018
This week we start to learn how to use string to do s lot of things, we start to learn how to cut the string by using midpoint code, and cut a sentence or a word to two parts, or three parts.
Then find out all the letter that is in the word or find all the letter that you want to find, and print them out.
And to use len of some thing to sount how many words or letter is in that sentence or word. it will be very usefull after I start to code for separating the sentence and then flipe them.
Last is use split and revers, to first separate the sentence and then use revers to revers the words or the whole sentence, which I have no idea waht is use of that.

This wook we start to learn the python 2, and the python 2 started from how to get string done. 
The string is the work of one should put the raw input to the computer and the other one can put something in there and the computer will work it to get them together.
The next is to get an integer, the integer is a number that don't have decimal on it, it will only do the calculation btween 0 to above.
The next is the flowding point, the flowding point, can sove the problem on all the number, you neec to have a decimal on the number, so the computer should calculate all the numbedr that can be calculed.
The nect is booliam, what it is, is that it can have several true and fales equations, and all them can be put together, and the computer will tell you if the statement, is true or fales at the moment.

# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week we start to learn how to get our home work in to the github and add the stuff to git hub. 
The command git pull is use for when the group of people is typing the project and you need to know what others have done, so you and them are puting down the same thing at the same time. 
The next command is git push, This comman is mainly for when you need to add things to the github and let the others to see what have you done and the others and pull you work.
Then the last one is git add . this command is more use full to just add all the things, to github, and get the file that you have done all in to where you need them at, after add, you can use commit to add what is that file or folder is about.
