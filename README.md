# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week we start to learn how to get our home work in to the github and add the stuff to git hub. 
The command git pull is use for when the group of people is typing the project and you need to know what others have done, so you and them are puting down the same thing at the same time. 
The next command is git push, This comman is mainly for when you need to add things to the github and let the others to see what have you done and the others and pull you work.
Then the last one is git add . this command is more use full to just add all the things, to github, and get the file that you have done all in to where you need them at, after add, you can use commit to add what is that file or folder is about.
